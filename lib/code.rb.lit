== Code ==
When parsing a literati document, we need to store code fragments that
we've extracted. These code fragments maintain their separate lines,
because we need to preserve whitespace to support languages like Python.
@ doc

== Variable declarations ==
code_lines - Lines of source code, kept as lines so we can preserve white
			 space

@code_lines = []

== Initialisation ==

def initialize

== @code.rb ==
class Code
	Variable declarations.
	Initialisation.
